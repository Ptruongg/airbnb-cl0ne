# `Airbnb Cl0ne`

# Intro
This is Airbnb Cl0ne where my project is a replica of Airbnb.

Airbnb Cl0ne is a website where anyone can go and book spots around the world. As spot owners they are able to create, edit, and delete their spots.
Visitors are able to book any spot and create reviews for the spots they have visited.
